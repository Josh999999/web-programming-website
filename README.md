This is a website that I made for my web programming unit at university


This is a website that I made for my web programming unit at university - this site lets regular users browse a guitar store where they can add items to their basket and checkout with them (removes them from the database). Administrative users can manage the store: Add new guitars, amps, etc, delete items from the store and update existing items. All users can also manage their accounts: delete, create, update


Content of the repository:
  - SQL Script - This creates that database that the project uses
  - JavaScript scripts contains the interactivity for the site (mainly error checking in forms)
  - HTML / PHP - These provide the pages for the site and the backend logic for the operations that interact with the database (there interact using the PHP mysqli module)
  - CSS - Styling for the pages
