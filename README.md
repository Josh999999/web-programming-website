This is a website that I made for my web programming unit at university - this site lets regular users browse a guitar store where they can add items to their basket and checkout with them (removes them from the database). Administrative users can manage the store: Add new guitars, amps, etc, delete items from the store and update existing items. All users can also manage their accounts: delete, create, update
